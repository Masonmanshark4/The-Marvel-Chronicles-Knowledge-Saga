## Description
We're a trio of budding computer engineers diving into our inaugural group venture, dubbed "The-Marvel-Chronicles-Knowledge-Saga". This project harnesses the power of the Marvel API to create an engaging picture quiz centered on Marvel characters. Participants are shown images of various characters, followed by multiple-choice questions to identify them. Scores are revealed at the quiz's conclusion, enhancing the interactive experience. Additionally, we've integrated the Google API to facilitate any necessary research, ensuring a seamless and informative user journey through the Marvel universe. 

The launched site:  https://masonmanshark4.github.io/The-Marvel-Chronicles-Knowledge-Saga/

## Introduction
The idea of a quiz with a search bar came up when we were presented with the list of potential API usable for the project. The team collectively liked the idea of using Marvels APIs and with there own quiz API it was decided. It wasn't hard to pick a good second that would make sense and work well. Google's Progammable Search Engine made it straight forward on implementing that it paried well with the theme.

## Process
This project is using two API’s, the first being the Marvel API that we are using to pull a list of characters and their images to be displayed and then a list of four characters are listed to choose from. Along with the search engine provided by Google that hosts a search bar to which inputs are use in a basic web search.

The break down of tasks came to who was willing to do what. Not one of us wasn’t willing to pitch in but not one of us felt weak against any of the tasks at hand. It became tasks done by volunteer.

The main challenge we faced in particular was organizing ourselves to make sure the structure of our code didn’t end in a jungle vine of a mess. We were all able to find a foothold of something we could each do and pull together a solid working site.

The success came after long trial and error. Getting two APIs to work with each other in order to make a comprehensive quiz. Sorting out the finer details of the search engine 

## Features
The two main features our site provides to users are a search engine by google that searches the web for relevant results based on your search terms. It alos provides a simple character quiz with multiple choice answers from Marvel's API.

## Usage
The ideal use for this site is for users to be able to test their knowledge, while still having direct acess to search for and find the answers they are looking for. The quiz should be to test the users knowledge of Marvel characters, and have a Google search bar ready for them to look any answers they may have gotten wrong. 

## Instalation
There are no installations needed.

## Credits
Credit to my teacher and assistant teacher, Mr. Ragheed and Mr. Torres, for giving me the nessacary guidance to understand the coding languages. Along with Ohio State University for creating the Coding Bootcmap.
