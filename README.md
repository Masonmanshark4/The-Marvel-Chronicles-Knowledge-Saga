## Description
Using the Google Search Engine, Marvel Character Generator and Marvel Quiz API we have made a dual purpose site meant to allow users to search for and quiz themselves on Marvel knowledge. This project is a accumulation of our abilities, knowledge and teamwork to which we put to practice here in The Marvel Chronicles: Knowledge Saga. Here is a Preview before launch version 0.0.1:

The launched site:  https://masonmanshark4.github.io/The-Marvel-Chronicles-Knowledge-Saga/

## Introduction
The idea of a quiz with a search bar came up when we were presented with the list of potential API usable for the project. The team collectively liked the idea of using Marvels APIs and with there own quiz API it was decided. It wasn't hard to pick a good second that would make sense and work well. Google's Progammable Search Engine made it straight forward on implementing that it paried well with the theme.

## Features
The two main features our site provides to users are a search engine by google that searches the web for relevant results based on your search terms. It alos provides a simple character quiz with multiple choice answers from Marvel's API.

## Usage
The ideal use for this site is for users to be able to test their knowledge, while still having direct acess to search for and find the answers they are looking for. The quiz should be to test the users knowledge of Marvel characters, and have a Google search bar ready for them to look any answers they may have gotten wrong. 

## Instalation
There are no installations needed.

## Credits
